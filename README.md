# Computer-Vision-Nanodegree-Excercise-Master

Welcome to our collection of computer vision assignments and projects.
This repository contains a variety of assignments and projects that cover different computer vision techniques and concepts, including image processing, object detection, and deep learning. You will find assignments on topics such as blue screen technology, canny edge detection, convolutional layer visualization, and Fourier Transform of filters.
In addition, you will find projects on medical image processing, background removal using green screen technology, and converting images to the HSV color space. Other assignments include HOG feature extraction and examples, Hough circle and line detection, image pyramids, K-means image segmentation, Pytorch basics and visualizing RGB channels. All the projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to use and learn from these resources.
